    <p>Currently (2020-06-27) temperature (BMP180, DHT22, DS18B20), atmospheric pressure (BMP180), and relative humidity (DHT22) are read directly from sensors with Python libraries (mostly Adafruit) on the Raspberry Pi.
    The T-cobbler breakout board and ribbon cable serve to make interfacing and wiring up the Raspberry Pi a lot easier
    The same routine also uses temperature and relative humidity (RH) to calculate dew point, since this is a lot more informative (to me, at least) than RH.
    Either way, this information isn't so interesting by itself, so there's no data to post yet since the log has only been run for testing so far.</p>
    <p>MQ9 and MQ135 gas sensors and the PPD42 particle counter are connected to the Arduino Uno:
    The gas sensors have an analog output, so they interface directly with the Arduino but would require and A-to-D converter to go directly to the Raspberry Pi.
    The PPD42 runs on a digital 5V out which lines up with the Arduino - for the Raspberry Pi a voltage divider or step-down would be required.
    This is a long way of saying I could use the Raspberry Pi for everything, but I have an Arduino, so why not?
    The gas and particle sensors are present in order to get an absolute measure on pollutants like CO, NO<sub>x</sub> and PM2.5 and then to use CO<sub>2</sub> levels to calculate some gross emission factors.
    Finally, ambient sound levels should/might get monitored with the microphone, but that is the last thing on the list since I am far more interested in particulates.
    Also, as long as the neighbor is continuing to practice the French horn, I won't be able to take a good baseline on a tolerable noise level...</p>
