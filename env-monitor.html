    <p>Currently (2020-06-24) temperature (BMP180, DHT22, DS18B20), atmospheric pressure (BMP180), and relative humidity (DHT22) are read directly from sensors with Python libraries (mostly Adafruit) on the Raspberry Pi.
    The T-cobbler breakout board and ribbon cable serve to make interfacing and wiring up the Raspberry Pi a lot easier
    The same routine also uses temperature and relative humidity (RH) to calculate dew point, since this is a lot more informative (to me, at least) than RH.
    Either way, this information isn't so interesting by itself, so there's no data to post yet since the log has only been run for testing so far.
    Next up is to interface MQ9 and MQ135 gas sensors and the PPD particle counter in order to get an absolute measure on pollutants like CO, NO<sub>x</sub> and PM2.5 and then to use CO<sub>2</sub> levels to calculate some gross emission factors.
    These may get interfaced either through the Arduino or Raspberry Pi - TBD.
    Finally, ambient sound levels should/might get monitored with the microphone, but that is the last thing on the list since I am far more interested in particulates.</p>
