    <h1>Working to have control over my interactions with Amazon, Google, Facebook, etc.</h1>
    <h2><i>Everything is predicated on having a cellphone, so...</i></h2>
    <p>I use this same heading in my trail electronics, but it's still true here.
    I recently became the proud new owner of a <a href="https://www.pine64.org/pinephone/">Pine Phone</a> which allows me to freely try out <a href="https://wiki.pine64.org/index.php/PinePhone_Software_Releases">different operating systems</a> and control everything in the way that I am used to with my personal computers.
    The long-term plan is for the software developed for the phone to merge into the mainline software for the various Linux distributions so that there is a continuity across devices (meaning the phone is really a pocket version of the desktop computer).</p>
    <p>As of 30 August, I am running <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/">Arch Linux</a> on my <a href=https://github.com/dreemurrs-embedded/Pine64-Arch/releases">phone</a> since it is simple and lightweight (as advertised) and working well.
    I am hoping to move to <a href="https://getfedora.org/">Fedora</a> on my phone once it is <a href="https://github.com/nikhiljha/pp-fedora-sdsetup/releases/">more mature</a> since that is my desktop Linux distribution of choice since about ten years now.</p>
    <p>As expected, the same applications aren't available, but most useful services that are distributed as smartphone applications can be accomplished with a web browser on a computer and this works well in meeting my needs.
    <a href="https://www.whatsapp.com">WhatsApp</a>, of course, is a hangup for many, but I am moving away from it.
    The core functionality is offered using the <a href="https://matrix.org/">Matrix</a> protocol.
    Just like with email, you can choose your client or web interface and your server.
    The real plus with Matrix, however, is its support for bridging to unify messengers.
    In many of the discussion groups for software development, the Matrix channel includes bridges to groups in Telegram, IRC, and/or Discord in order to enable full cross-protocol real-time communication, i.e. no one is forced to used Matrix.
    Integration of end-to-end encryption and audio and video calling is also underway in many clients, with <a href="https://element.io/">Element</a> being the current standard-bearer (although I am testing and contributing a tiny bit to <a href="https://dittochat.org/">Ditto</a>).
    
    <h2><i>I also hate advertisements and tracking</i></h2>
    <p>Another simple and cool project has been to block ads on my home network using <a href="https://pi-hole.net/">Pi-hole</a></p>
    <p>And for fun, I replaced my Roku and Amazon Fire TV with my own Raspberry Pi / LibreElec / Kodi SmartTV solution.</p>
    <p><i>More to come...</p></i>
